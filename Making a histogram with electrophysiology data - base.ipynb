    "# Introduction\n",
    "Today we will be using electrophysiology data to better understand how a particular set of drugs effect GABA release. Electrophysiology is a technique that is used to measure electrical changes in cells. In this example, we will be using whole-cell voltage clamp recording data. With this technique, we lower a glass pipette down to the surface of the cell membrane and develop a tight seal with the cell membrane. Then we \"break in\" to the cell membrane, meaning that the fluid within our pipette tip is continuous with the intracellular fluid within the cell. This allows us electrical access to the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing this electical access, we can inject current to maintain a specific voltage within the cell. In voltage clamp mode, we are holding the cell at a fixed resting potential (-70 mV). Ion channels in the cell's membrane result in current flowing in or out of the cell. Normally these currents would lead to a change in the cell's membrane voltage. However, we inject current into the cell to counteract these currents, thereby maintaining the cell's potential at -70 mV. Here, we record the amount of current injected into the cell as a proxy for the current generated by the ion channel. This data is then used to deduce how these ion channels work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we used electrophysiology to assess the GABAergic miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current (mIPSC).\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src = \"Mini_zoom.jpg\" width=\"600\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "Action potentials generate large currents that mask the small contributions from post-synaptic currents. By adding TTX to the incubation medium, we can prevent these action potentials from forming, thereby enabling us to measure the small currents generated by various ion channels. To isolate the role of a particular channel (or family of channels), we need to use various agonists and antagonists. For example, NBQX is an antagonist of AMPA receptors (i.e., it blocks the activity of these receptors). By adding NBQX to the incubation media, we can rule out AMPA receptors as the source of the currents we measure. Cadmium (Cd) is a drug that blocks voltage-gated calcium channels. By using this drug, we are able to assess whether a cellular process is dependent on these voltage-gated calcium channels. Rimonabant (RIM) is a cannabinoind-1 (CB1) receptor antagonist. Adding RIM to the incubation media, we can assess whether the CB1 receptor has 'tone' within this brain region, i.e. whether the CB1 receptor has perpetual activity that is modulating neural activity. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Using these drugs, we are able to sequester GABA spontaneous release. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter whose transmission hyperpolarizes the neuron (through chloride and potassium channels). GABAergic mIPSCs are a way to investigate spontaneous GABA release, by blocking action potentials and glutamate signaling we can sequester GABA spontaneous release through these recordings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the downward reflections in a recording represents GABA release onto our recording cell, as we are measuring the post-synaptic effect, or the change in post-synaptic potential. Drugs can have a major effect on neural signaling processes, the goal of this experiment to examine the effect of these two different drugs on GABAergic mIPSP characteristics. The characteristics that we are interested in are the input current, the rise time, the decay, and the inter-event intervals, as well as the frequency of the events within a condition (drug vs no drug).

For instance, the statistical fit of the data within each `drug` condition gives us important information about the mean amplitude and the variance. \n",

    "Brad's note: The various distributions have a `fit` method that returns the fitted parameters. `norm` has two parameters, loc and scale. These translate to mu and sigma (mean and standard deviation). `scipy.stats` has a formulation for the various distributions that do not map well to more common formulations used in biological sciencies. I think the parameter names of the `scipy.stats` tend to be oriented towards the ones used by statisticians and mathematicians, so I always have to Google to find out the correct mapping of loc, scale, etc. to the values I want.\n",

    "Notice that we're switching from a histogram, where we calculate the number of occurances per bin, to a density plot, which is an approximation of the probability density function. This is a normalized histogram in which the value of each bin is the probablity of making that particular observation (i.e., that the mEPSC amplitude will fall within that bin). We make this switch so that the y-values returned by `norm.pdf` can be compared directly with the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we used `curve_fit` last week? We'll use it again this week. However, rather than fitting our own equation, we will fit an equation already made available via the `scipy.stats` module. Specifically, we will fit the function provided by `norm.pdf` to our data. The function `norm.pdf` takes three arguments (`x`, `loc` and `scale`) and returns the PDF (probability density function) at each value in `x`. The `loc` and `scale` parameters map to the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution.\n",
