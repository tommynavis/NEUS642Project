The data that we will be working with are whole-cell electrophysiology recordings made from acute brain slices from rats, an example trace is shown below.

The data consists of multiple experiments for each concentration. \n",

These channels allow potassium to leave the cell, and this is what creates the electrical current that we are measuring. Because there could be variable numbers of GIRK channels on a cell, the morphine current responses will be normalized to the current responses induced by a saturating concentration of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist UK, which also acts on GIRKs. Because UK is very potent, it will give us the maximum GIRK response possible. \n",
